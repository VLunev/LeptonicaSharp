		/// (2) The array of threshold values, one for each tile, constitutes
		/// a highly downscaled image.  This array is optionally
		/// smoothed using a convolution.  The full width and height of the
		/// convolution kernel are (2  %smoothx + 1) and (2  %smoothy + 1).<para/>
		///
		/// (3) The minimum tile dimension allowed is 16.  If such small
		/// tiles are used, it is recommended to use smoothing, because
		/// without smoothing, each small tile determines the splitting
		/// threshold independently.  A tile that is entirely in the
		/// image bg will then hallucinate fg, resulting in a very noisy
		/// binarization.  The smoothing should be large enough that no
		/// tile is only influenced by one type (fg or bg) of pixels,
		/// because it will force a split of its pixels.<para/>
		///
		/// (4) To get a single global threshold for the entire image, use
		/// input values of %sx and %sy that are larger than the image.
		/// For this situation, the smoothing parameters are ignored.<para/>

		/// one whose values are less than the threshold and another
		/// whose values are greater than or equal to the threshold.
		/// This is the same use of 'threshold' as in pixThresholdToBinary().<para/>

		/// (6) The scorefract is the fraction of the maximum Otsu score, which

		/// is searched.  See numaSplitDistribution() for details on the
		/// underlying method of choosing a threshold.<para/>
		///
		/// (7) This uses enables a modified version of the Otsu criterion for
