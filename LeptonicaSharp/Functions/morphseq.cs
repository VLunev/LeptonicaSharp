		/// x or X  (replicative binary expansion)
		/// b or B  (add a border of 0 pixels of this size)
		/// ~ The args to the morphological operations are bricks of hits,
		/// and are formatted as a.b, where a and b are horizontal and
		/// vertical dimensions, rsp.
		/// ~ The args to the reduction are a sequence of up to 4 integers,
		/// each from 1 to 4.
		/// ~ The arg to the expansion is a power of two, in the set
		/// {2, 4, 8, 16}.<para/>
		///
		/// (11) An example valid sequence is:
		/// "b32 + o1.3 + C3.1 + r23 + e2.2 + D3.2 + X4"
		/// In this example, the following operation sequence is carried out:
		/// b32: Add a 32 pixel border around the input image
		/// o1.3: Opening with vert sel of length 3 (e.g., 1 x 3)
		/// C3.1: Closing with horiz sel of length 3  (e.g., 3 x 1)
		/// r23: Two successive 2x2 reductions with rank 2 in the first
		/// and rank 3 in the second.  The result is a 4x reduced pix.
		/// e2.2: Erosion with a 2x2 sel (origin will be at x,y: 0,0)
		/// d3.2: Dilation with a 3x2 sel (origin will be at x,y: 1,0)
		/// X4: 4x replicative expansion, back to original resolution<para/>
		///
		/// (12) The safe closing is used.  However, if you implement a
		/// closing as separable dilations followed by separable erosions,
		/// it will not be safe.  For that situation, you need to add
		/// a sufficiently large border as the first operation in
		/// the sequence.  This will be removed automatically at the

		/// ~ When computing what is sufficient, remember that if
		/// reductions are carried out, the border is also reduced.
		/// ~ The border is removed at the end, so if a border is
		/// added at the beginning, the result must be at the
